Usually while connecting with the wifi we have to enter some password to access the network, but we are not directly able to see the password we have entered earlier i.e password of saved network. In this article, we will see how we can get all the saved WiFi name and passwords using Python, in order to do this we will use subprocess module of python.
Wi-Fi is a wireless networking that allows devices such as computers (laptops and desktops), mobile devices (smartphones and wearables), and other equipment (printers and video cameras) to interface with the Internet.
